FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) is a simple d3 visualisation of income, expenditure, liability and assets. All together, we get a FIRE requirement = `(essential expenditure items * 25)` which in turn gives us a FIRE time = `(FIRE requirement / (income - expenditure))`.

### CSV Data Template

To use this app effectively you'd need to import your own data in a set template. Head over to the template [README](https://github.com/evley/fire/tree/master/src/assets/template) for more details.
